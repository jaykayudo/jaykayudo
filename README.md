 Hi, I am Joshua 👋! A FullStack Software Engineer with experience in building and deploying, on Linux-based servers (mostly Debian-based), Web Applications with Python (Django, Flask but mostly Django), Web Applications with Node (Express Js), Mobile Applications with React Native, HTML, CSS (Pure, Sass, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Materialize) and JavaScript (Vanilla, jQuery, and React). I also have some experience with some programming languages which includes PHP, Java, C++, C#, Ruby . I have a passion for creating efficient customer-centric software solutions to complex problems. I solve real-world challenges by designing, building, and implementing end-to-end systems. I am very passionate about Software Engineering and always interested in solving problems regardless of industry. Ultimately, I dream of being part of a team where I can actively contribute to building what matters while learning and honing my skills.
